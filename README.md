## **🎯 Why This Project Exists**
This suite was originally built as part of the Go‑Ahead mobile app testing strategy, covering critical flows and ensuring consistent behaviour across platforms. It now serves as a reference for my approach to mobile E2E automation using Detox and JavaScript.

## **📌 Notes**
This repo focuses on clarity and practical patterns rather than building a full framework. For more complete automation suites, see my **Playwright Login Suite** and **iOS XCUI Automation Suite**.
